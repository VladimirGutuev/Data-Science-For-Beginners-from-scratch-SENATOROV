"""Exercises: syntax variables and numbers in python."""

# **This notebook is an exercise in the [Python](https://www.kaggle.com/learn/
# python) course.  You can reference the tutorial at [this link](https://www.
# kaggle.com/colinmorris/hello-python).**

#

# Welcome to your first set of Python coding problems.  If this is your first
# time using Kaggle Notebooks, welcome!
#
# Notebooks are composed of blocks (called "cells") of text and code. Each of
# these is editable, though you'll mainly be editing the code cells to answer
# some questions.
#
# To get started, try running the code cell below (by pressing the ► button,
# or clicking on the cell and pressing ctrl+enter on your keyboard).

# +
# from learntools.core import binder
# from learntools.python.ex1 import *

print("You've successfully run some Python code")
print("Congratulations!")
print("Hello, Kaggle!")
# -

# Try adding another line of code in the cell above and re-running it.
#
# Now let's get a little fancier:  Add a new code cell by clicking on an
# existing code cell, hitting the escape key, and then hitting the `a` or `b`
# key.  The `a` key will add a cell above the current cell, and `b` adds a
# cell below.
#
# Great! Now you know how to use Notebooks.
#
# Each hands-on exercise starts by setting up our feedback and code checking
# mechanism. Run the code cell below to do that. Then you'll be ready to move
# on to question 0.

# +
# binder.bind(globals())

print("Setup complete! You're ready to start question 0.")
# -

# # 0.
#
# *This is a silly question intended as an introduction to the format we use
# for hands-on exercises throughout all Kaggle courses.*
#
# **What is your favorite color? **
#
# To complete this question, create a variable called `color` in the cell
# below with an appropriate value. The function call `q0.check()` (which we've
# already provided in the cell below) will check your answer.

# +
# create a variable called color with an appropriate value on the line below
# (Remember, strings in Python must be enclosed in 'single' or "double" quotes)
color: str = "blue"

# Check your answer
# q0.check()
# -

# Didn't get the right answer? How do you not even know your own favorite
# color?!
#
# Delete the `#` in the line below to make one of the lines run. You can
# choose between getting a hint or the full answer by choosing which line to
# remove the `#` from.
#
# Removing the `#` is called uncommenting, because it changes that line from a
# "comment" which Python doesn't run to code, which Python does run.

# +
# q0.hint()
# q0.solution()
# -

# The upcoming questions work the same way. The only thing that will change
# are the question numbers. For the next question, you'll call `q1.check()`,
# `q1.hint()`, `q1.solution()`, for question 2, you'll call `q2.check()`, and
# so on.

# # 1.
#
# Complete the code below. In case it's helpful, here is the table of
# available arithmetic operations:
#
#
#
# Здесь была таблица с арифметическими операциями
#
# <span style="display:none"></span>
#

# +
pi = 3.14159  # approximate
diameter = 3

# Create a variable called 'radius' equal to half the diameter
radius: float = diameter / 2

# Create a variable called 'area', using the formula
# for the area of a circle: pi times the radius squared
area: float = pi * radius**2

# Check your answer
# q1.check()

# +
# Uncomment and run the lines below if you need help.
# q1.hint()
# q1.solution()
# -

# <hr/>
#
# # 2.
#
# Add code to the following cell to swap variables `a` and `b` (so that `a`
# refers to the object previously referred to by `b` and vice versa).

# +
# Setup code - don't touch this part
# If you're curious, these are examples of lists. We'll talk about
# them in depth a few lessons from now. For now, just know that they're
# yet another type of Python object, like int or float.
a_letter = [1, 2, 3]
b_letter = [3, 2, 1]
# q2.store_original_ids()

# Your code goes here. Swap the values to which a and b refer.
# If you get stuck, you can always uncomment one or both of the lines in
# the next cell for a hint, or to peek at the solution.
a_letter, b_letter = b_letter, a_letter

# Check your answer
# q2.check()

# +
# q2.hint()

# +
# q2.solution()
# -

# <hr/>
#
# # 3a.
#
# Add parentheses to the following expression so that it evaluates to 1.

print((5 - 3) // 2)

# +
# q3.a.hint()

# +
# Check your answer (Run this code cell to receive credit!)
# q3.a.solution()
# -

# # 3b.  <span title="A bit spicy" style="color: darkgreen ">🌶️</span>
#
# <small>Questions, like this one, marked a spicy pepper are a bit harder.</
# small>
#
# Add parentheses to the following expression so that it evaluates to 0.

print((8 - 3) * (2 - (1 + 1)))

# +
# q3.b.hint()

# +
# Check your answer (Run this code cell to receive credit!)
# q3.b.solution()

# # 4.
# Alice, Bob and Carol have agreed to pool their Halloween candy and split it
# evenly among themselves.
# For the sake of their friendship, any candies left over will be smashed. For
# example, if they collectively
# bring home 91 candies, they'll take 30 each and smash 1.
#
# Write an arithmetic expression below to calculate how many candies they must
# smash for a given haul.

# +
# Variables representing the number of candies collected by alice, bob, and
# carol
alice_candies = 121
bob_candies = 77
carol_candies = 109

# Your code goes here! Replace the right-hand side of this assignment with an
# expression
# involving alice_candies, bob_candies, and carol_candies
to_smash: int = (alice_candies + bob_candies + carol_candies) % 3

# Check your answer
# q4.check()

# +
# q4.hint()
# q4.solution()
# -

# # Keep Going
#
# Next up, you'll **[learn to write new functions and understand functions
# others write](https://www.kaggle.com/colinmorris/functions-and-getting-help)
# **. This will make you at least 10 times more productive as a Python
# programmer.
